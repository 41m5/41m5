Hi, I’m Amie. I’m a graphic designer turned digital project manager, now training as a full-stack web developer, with a passion for building products and services that improve lives.

Previously I have...
• Project managed / product owned a CRM build and migration for a membership organisation of 175,000.
• Originated, project managed and product owned an iOS and Android app.
• Managed internal disaster response to a cyber incident, including upskilling and change management for an organisation of 250 staff and stakeholders.
• Managed and created comms, video and design for numerous national industrial and political campaigns.
• Designed internationally focussed academic research, financial reports and legal publications.

With my background in design thinking, project management, and now web development, I offer a well-rounded perspective for start-ups looking to build meaningful, user-focused solutions.
