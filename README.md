👋 Hi, I'm Amie and I'm learning to be a full stack developer.

🧑🏻‍💻 I’m a trained graphic designer and project management professional with more than ten years experience. 

🍎 Over the past three years I’ve been following an ever-growing interest in product, coding and user experience. 

🚀 I’m now looking for the chance to learn alongside others in an environment that champions creativity and user value.
